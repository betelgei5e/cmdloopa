# cmdloopa

**A simple python script that takes any arbitrary command as an argument and runs the given command on loop until the user end it with Ctrl-C**

The script will be expanded and improved over time, but the focus on simplicity and singularity of function will remain.


**Please be warned, this is a work-in-process and a proof-of-concept.**

**The safety elements will come later in the future.**

**Loops can be extremely dangerous! Use with caution and at your own risk!!!**

## How to use

```
python3 cmdloopa "ls -lah"
```
